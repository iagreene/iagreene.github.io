<h4	style="color: purple;" align="center"> Hi everyone! My name is Isabelle, and I am 17 years old and I currently attend school at the High School of American Studies in the Bronx. I was born and raised in the Bronx. Having attended a very academically challenging high school, I found myself encountering many struggles in both my social and academic life. During my sophomore year, I became very depressed for many different reasons. I would spend hours working on homework each night, and my grades were slipping drastically. I also isolated myself, I became very antisocial, and never wanted to leave my house. I was fortunate to have a therapist, but I believed that no other teenager could relate to how I felt. During this time, I realized how important it was to create a website designed for teens that would allow them to share their experiences, seek help and advice, and realize that they are not alone. It is important to break the stigma surrounding mental health, and the most important step in this process should be talking about these issues and helping one another.</h4>
